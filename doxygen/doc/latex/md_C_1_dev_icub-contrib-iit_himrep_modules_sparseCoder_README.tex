\subsubsection*{Dependencies}

This module needs the \href{https://github.com/pitzer/SiftGPU}{\tt Sift\+G\+PU} library. Since instructions on how to compile the library are platform-\/dependent, we do not provide intallation support here. However, if you need assistance, do not hesitate to ask by creating a dedicated issue.

\subsubsection*{Compilation}

Once the library has been built as explained above, you can compile this module just by setting the {\ttfamily B\+U\+I\+L\+D\+\_\+sparse\+Coder} flag to {\ttfamily ON} as explained \href{https://www.github.com/robotology/himrep#compilation}{\tt here}.
